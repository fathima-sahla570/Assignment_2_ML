In the field of Machine Learning, high-quality data plays a crucial role in building effective predictive models. Raw data often contains missing values, inconsistencies, outliers, and noise, which can significantly impact the performance of machine learning algorithms. To address these challenges, Data Preprocessing is a fundamental step in the data pipeline, ensuring the dataset is clean, well-structured, and ready for analysis.

This project, ML_Assignment_2: EDA and Preprocessing, aims to design and implement a robust data preprocessing system that systematically enhances the quality, reliability, and usability of the data. The dataset provided will undergo Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, Encoding, and Feature Scaling, making it suitable for machine learning models.

Objectives of the Assignment
The primary goal of this assignment is to:

Explore the dataset by identifying unique values, performing statistical analysis, and renaming columns where necessary.

Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, treating outliers, and ensuring consistency in formatting.

Analyze the data through filtering, visualization, and pattern recognition.

Encode categorical features using techniques like one-hot encoding and label encoding to make them machine-readable.

Scale numerical features using StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler to normalize the dataset for better model performance.

Significance of the Project
By completing this project, we will gain hands-on experience in handling real-world data challenges and applying essential data preprocessing techniques. The transformed dataset will be better suited for machine learning algorithms, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions.

This project is a crucial step in understanding the importance of data preprocessing in the ML workflow and will serve as a strong foundation for building advanced models in future assignments.
